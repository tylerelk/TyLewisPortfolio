    "As a registered nurse with extensive experience in the operating room, I've spent years working directly with cutting-edge medical technology—from electronic medical records to surgical robots and imaging systems. My journey in healthcare led me to a natural curiosity about the tech behind the tools I use every day, which is why I made the transition to software engineering. I'm now focused on building solutions that bridge the gap between technology and healthcare.",
    "I specialize in front-end development using JavaScript and TypeScript, leveraging React to create intuitive, user-friendly applications. Additionally, I've spent time exploring the .NET ecosystem and have had a lot of fun with Blazor and MAUI. While I've gravitated primarily towards front-end development, I also spent considerable time during my education learning back-end, primarily with Node.js and Python.",
    "My background in nursing has equipped me with critical skills such as organizational leadership, high-pressure problem solving, collaboration, and multitasking — skills I bring to my work as a developer. I'm a naturally detail-oriented and focused individual, and I approach every project with a dedication to delivering high-quality, polished results.",
    "I'm excited to apply my unique perspective to a software engineering role, ideally with a company that uses technology to improve the way we care for one another. Outside of my professional work, I'm also exploring game development and continuing to build a strong portfolio of projects to showcase my skills."
